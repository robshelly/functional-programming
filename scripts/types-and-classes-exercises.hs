--- Type and Classes Exercises

-- Exercise 1: What are the types of...
-- ['a', 'b', 'c']              = [char]
-- ('a', 'b', 'c')              = (char, char, char)
-- [(False, '0'), (True, '1')]  = [(Bool, char)]
-- ([False, '0'], ['0', '1'])   =  ???
-- [tail, init, reverse]        = [[a] -> [a]]

--- Exercise 2: Write down definition that have the following types
bools :: [Bool]
bools = [True, False, True]

nums :: [[Int]]
nums = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]

add :: Int -> Int -> Int-> Int
add x y z = x + y + z

-- i have no idea how to do these!
